SERVER SECURITY MISCONFIGURATION WRITEUP - BEST WRITEUP TO MASTER THIS VULNERABILITY RANGE: 

Server misconfiguration attacks exploit configuration weaknesses found in web and application servers. Many servers come with unnecessary default and sample files, including applications, configuration files, scripts, and webpages. They may also have unnecessary services enabled, such as content management and remote administration functionality. Debugging functions may be enabled or administrative functions may be accessible to anonymous users. Servers may include well-known default accounts and passwords. Failure to fully lock down or harden the server can leave improperly set file and directory permissions.All of these server misconfiguration features can be used by attackers to bypass authentication methods and gain access to sensitive information, perhaps with elevated privileges. SSL vulnerabilities such as misconfigured certificates and encryption settings, the use of default certificates, and improper authentication implementation with external systems all have the potential to compromise the confidentiality of information.

[+]No Rate Limiting on Form
 [-]Registration
 [-]Login
 [-]Email-Triggering
 [-]SMS-Triggering
 There is no limit range on number of attempts in registration,login,email and sms.As this could lead to possible bruteforcing and password guesing.
 Email and sms can leads to bombarding to other user's email or phone numbers with malicious intention.

[+]Unsafe File Upload
 [-]No Antivirus
 [-]No Size Limit
 [-]File Extension Filter Bypass
 There is no check on the exetension for the file user has uploaded could lead to upload of exploit.No check over file upload or bypassing can lead to serious threat.Bypassing can be done by manipulating name of the file like attack.sh to attack.sh.png if images are allowed to be uploaded.
 Remediation : Proper check on extension in client side as well as on server side should be done to avoid exploiation of vulnerability file upload.

[-]Cookie Scoped to Parent Domain
 ISSUE : https://portswigger.net/kb/issues/00500300_cookie-scoped-to-parent-domain

[+]Missing Secure or HTTPOnly Cookie Flag
 [-]Session Token
  Secure is a flag used by developer to make cookie unreadable for user from javascript which prevents session hijacking possiblities.it could help to read cookie of other users using document.cookie function via stored cross site scripting.
 [-]Non-Session Cookie
  Secure flag can be set to the other authenticated tokens as well to prevent from javascript read.
  for example in csrf token or any other authenticated token.
